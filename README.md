# Basic-Unsupervised-learning-techniques
<h3>Business Context:</h3>
<p>Developing a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. (The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables)</p>


<h3>Solution Offered:</h3>
<p>This repository contains jupyter notebook which uses python3 to:
<ul> 
<li>Clean the Data</li>
<li>Build a k-means algorithm for clustering credit card data</li>
<li>Apply PCA to the dataset</li>
<li>Perform cluster analysis</li>
<li>Compare the performances of both models</li>
</ul>
And driving insights from the data
</p>

<h4>Note: Dataset used in this repository contains DUMMY values and shouldn't be used to draw parallels in real world!</h4>
